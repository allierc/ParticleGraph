Start with one of  '3' | '4' | 'supp4' | 'supp5' | 'supp6' | 'supp7' | 'supp8' | 'supp9' | 'supp10' | 'supp11' | 'supp12' | 'supp15' |'supp16' |'supp18' (because the others require manual intervention -> to be done later)

E.g., for figure 3 (start with this one, this is the easiest case - the other files generate data for other columns of the figure):
* look at config file (arbitrary_3)
* use config file in GNN_particles_Ntype.py and execute
  * data_generate
  * data_train
  * data_test
* in GNN_particles_PlotFigure.py set `f_list` to the right figure (maybe modify the config list if not all columns are computed) and execute

Use input data given by Cedric and pull it into the repository (into the graphs_data directory) piece by piece if it's missing
